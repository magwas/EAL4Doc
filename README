This is a documentation generator for CC EAL4 certification.
It has been succesfully used for certification of two game servers.

For your project I reccommend to start looking at styles/etc/rules.mk
to figure out how to create a working Makefile. Sorry, I could not provide one
due to NDA. Maybe I'll come up with some small mockup project in the future,
but don't hold your breath.
